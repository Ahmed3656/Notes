A **transaction** is a logical unit of work that groups one or more operations (queries) such as reading, inserting, updating, or deleting data into a single indivisible process. They ensure that a set of operations either completes entirely or not at all.

**Its Lifespan:** Begin | Commit | Rollback (unexpected ending "crash")

#### **Distributed Transaction**
A distributed transaction is an operation that updates data across multiple independent systems. Unlike a normal database transaction that works on one database, this one coordinates work across different services or databases to ensure they all succeed or all fail together.

**The key reason**: in microservices, each service has its own database. If you need to update several services at once, like creating an order and processing a payment, you need a way to make sure both steps complete successfully. If the payment fails, the order creation must also be reversed. A distributed transaction handles this coordination.

**It extends the "all-or-nothing" rule across service boundaries. So basically, it creates a logical unit of work that spans multiple physical systems.**

**For example:**
- Order Service —> Creates order
- Payment Service —> Charges customer
- If payment fails —> The system must cancel the order

That's why distributed transactions are complex but essential for maintaining consistency in distributed systems.
